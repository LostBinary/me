For years, I worked on the assembly line building cars. It's a job I enjoy and respect, but I felt I had to take a step further. It's not easy to leave behind what you know, but I **refuse to settle** and let my environment define my limits.

Now I'm studying for a vocational degree in Computer Systems and preparing on my own for certifications like ICDL Standard, CEH, and CompTIA Security+. Because if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that **it's never too late to reinvent yourself**.

### 🚀 Goal: Offensive Security

My goal is to work professionally in **offensive security** (pentesting, ethical hacking…). I'm not looking for hype or to feed my ego: I want to contribute, learn, and give back to the community some of what it has given me.

Here I'll be uploading my projects, labs, exercises, and everything that helps me grow and support others who, like me, come from tough backgrounds but with a lot of drive.
